### LeetCode
08/22/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/ (Solved using DFS)

08/22/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/ (Solved using dynamic programming /or greedy algo, was thinking of DFS at first place)

08/23/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/ (Solved using tweaked binary search)

08/23/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/as-far-from-land-as-possible/ (Searched for hint, then implemented BFS)

08/24/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/ (Solved using variable sliding window technique)

08/24/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/ (Tried with a mathematical appraoch, turned out it is Greedy)

08/25/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-swap/ (Thought of using List<Map.Entry<Integer,Integer>> but searched for easier int[] dynamic programming hint) 

08/25/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/ (Need to review it, can be solved using both Dynamic programming and two pointers) 

08/29/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array (Solved with a hint, no particular algo or ds)

08/29/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/ (Solved with array manipulation, instead using one for loop for everything, easier to break into smaller loops)

08/30/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search (Solved with DFS, trick is to unvisit necessart cells once a new direction search starts)

08/30/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/ (Solved by using hashSet since it has O(1) search time complexity)

08/31/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/ (Solved with a recursion method, similar to backtracking? There are multiple solutions, need to review others)

09/01/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/ (Solved with BFS using queue)

09/01/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node (Solved with BFS first, but it wants O(1) space so changed to node manipulation)

09/02/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water (Solved with two pointers algorithm)

09/02/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position (Solved with binary search)

09/04/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life (Solved with array manipulation)

09/04/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/ (Solved with elementary math)

09/05/2022 https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array (Solved with hint quickselect/quicksort, need to revisit)
